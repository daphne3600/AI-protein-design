Full pipeline\n","\n","### Vibe Coding\n","Code for this pipeline was initially developed using Claude Sonnet 4 and a prompt that provided a link to the manuscript with a suggested workflow for the notebook (similar to the steps above). Several fixes had to be made along the way, including addition of antibody alignment, different concatenation of the embeddings, and batching as the embeddings are generated to control for GPU memory limitations.\n","\n","Importantly, **when vibe coding, you need to check that the science is coded correctly**! Even though the pipeline runs, you will notice that this notebook does not replicate the results of the manuscript with high fidelity. In particular, the Kernel PCA plot here is fundamentally different from the one in the manuscript. Significant effort has been put into identifying the source of the discrepancy. The current thoughts are in two places. 1) the manuscript uses the AbNum server to generate Chothia numbering while this notebook utilizes ANARCI. The results of Chothia numbering with the [AbYsis server](http://www.abysis.org/) are different, altering the relative embeddings of antibodies. Alternative numbering schemes, including IMGT and Martin, have been implemented in an attempt to replicate the results, without success. 2) the manuscript documents the tokens utilized for gaps in the antibody alignment; these tokens correspond to masking tokens instead of gap/padding tokens. Tokenization differences will affect the calculation of embeddings. It is unclear if the interface to the pLMs has changed or if the authors tokenization strategy was chosen for a specific reason."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2fe5b973","metadata":{"id":"2fe5b973"},"source":["## Which csv files are used in this notebook?\n","\n","**Supplementary data**\n","Supplementary data was processed and cleaned in an effort to replicate the work in the manuscript. (See code in the section, \"Cleaning and segmenting the Supplementary Data\").\n","\n","**Updated database**\n","A second set of files was created from an up-to-date version of TheraSabDab. Here, subsets of the antibodies were created in attempts to deal with GPU memory issues. Batching fixed the problem and the full sets are available. Use a smaller set of antibodies to have a faster notebook as alignment and embedding can take some time on a large number of antibodies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ecf40777","metadata":{"id":"ecf40777"},"source":["##### Cleaning and segmenting the Supplementary Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"45f62846","metadata":{"id":"45f62846","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762613000710,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia","userId":"12215712277586225497"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["####################################\n","# It is not necessary to run the code in this section, as the files are made available.\n","# Code is provided for transparency in the event you might learn from it.\n","####################################\n","\n","# import pandas as pd\n","# approved_df = pd.read_excel(\"AntibodyTriagingWithEmbeddings/kmab_a_2472009_sm7938.xlsx\", sheet_name=\"1\",skiprows=0)\n","# all_df = pd.read_csv(\"AntibodyTriagingWithEmbeddings/Sweet-Jones_clean.csv\")\n","\n","# therap_df = all_df.loc[all_df['Barcode/Name'].str.contains('umab')]\n","# therap_df.rename(columns={'Barcode/Name':'Therapeutic','VH':'HeavySequence','VL':'LightSequence'}, inplace=True)\n","# therap_df['HeavySequence'] = therap_df['HeavySequence'].str.replace(' ','')\n","# therap_df['LightSequence'] = therap_df['LightSequence'].str.replace(' ','')\n","# therap_df.loc[therap_df['Therapeutic'].isin(approved_df.loc[approved_df['Status']=='Approved','Name'].values),'Highest_Clin_Trial']='Approved'\n","# therap_df.loc[therap_df['Therapeutic'].isin(approved_df.loc[approved_df['Status']=='Discontinued','Name'].values),'Highest_Clin_Trial']='Discontinued'\n","# therap_df.loc[therap_df['Therapeutic'].isin(approved_df.loc[approved_df['Status']=='In Trials','Name'].values),'Highest_Clin_Trial']='In Trials'\n","# therap_df.loc[therap_df['Therapeutic'].isin(approved_df.loc[approved_df['Status']=='Studied','Name'].values),'Highest_Clin_Trial']='Studied'\n","# therap_df[['Therapeutic','HeavySequence','LightSequence','Highest_Clin_Trial']].to_csv('Sweet-Jones_Martin_therapeutic_mabs.csv',index=False)\n","\n","# library_df = all_df.loc[~(all_df['Barcode/Name'].str.contains('umab'))]\n","# library_df.rename(columns={'Barcode/Name':'Therapeutic','VH':'HeavySequence','VL':'LightSequence'}, inplace=True)\n","# library_df['HeavySequence'] = library_df['HeavySequence'].str.replace(' ','')\n","# library_df['LightSequence'] = library_df['LightSequence'].str.replace(' ','')\n","# library_df['Highest_Clin_Trial'] = \"Hit_Antibody\"\n","# library_df[['Therapeutic','HeavySequence','LightSequence','Highest_Clin_Trial']].to_csv('Sweet-Jones_Martin_library_mabs.csv',index=False)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ff414a6b","metadata":{"id":"ff414a6b"},"source":["# 1.
